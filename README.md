### Introduction

Thank you for listening to my Citi Bike Rider Sharing Program presentation. This analysis will show the desired demographic, optimal ride station location & recommended maintenance schedule for the Citi Bike ride sharing program. I used the [historical dataset provided by Citibike from August 2019](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) for this study. 

### Observation 1: The majority of riders who use the Citi Bike program are annual subscribers
 - Over 80% of Citi Bike users have an annual subscription for the service.
 - Cost savings from purchasing the subscription over one time users is likely the reason for this.
 - This finding will help determine if single-use pricing reductions or promotional deals are needed to boost usage.

### Observation 2: The subscribers ride more on the weekdays
- Most riders are using the Citi Bike service as a means to commute from home to work.
- It is suggested by this observation that this choice is due to bike riding being faster to get to the destination than other means of transportation.
- Riding days and times depends heavily on the public transportation offering in the city and home to work commute schedule.
- Men are twice more likely to use the Citi Bike service than women. This inclination could possibly be related to requiring suitable wear for using the bike.
