# Citi Bike Ride Sharing Analysis

## Purpose

Present findings and recommendations on how to proceed with the launch of Citi Bike program in Des Moines by using a compelling data story telling methodology with intuitive visualizations in Tableau. Decide based on the findings and information on the new location if it is a good idea to invest in the bike rider sharing program.

### Introduction

Thank you for listening to my Citi Bike Rider Sharing Program presentation. This analysis will show the desired demographic, optimal ride station location & recommended maintenance schedule for the Citi Bike ride sharing program. I used the [historical dataset provided by Citibike from August 2019](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) for this study. 

### Observation 1: The majority of riders who use the Citi Bike program are annual subscribers
 - Over 80% of Citi Bike users have an annual subscription for the service.
 - Cost savings from purchasing the subscription over one time users is likely the reason for this.
 - This finding will help determine if single-use pricing reductions or promotional deals are needed to boost usage.

### Observation 2: The subscribers ride more on the weekdays (work days)
- Most riders are using the Citi Bike service as a means to commute from home to work.
- It is suggested by this observation that this choice is due to bike riding being faster to get to the destination than other means of transportation.
- Riding days and times depends heavily on the public transportation offering in the city and home to work commute schedule.
- Men are twice more likely to use the Citi Bike service than women. This inclination could possibly be related to requiring suitable wear for using the bike.

### Observation 3: Citi Bike users tend to be in the Millenial generation
- The birth year of riders falls heavily in between 1980 to 1996
- Citi Bike users which rely on the smart phone app to pay and navigate on the bike must be tech savvy.
- The spike in the year group for 1969 might be attributed to either the default setting in the Citi bike app for users who do not wish to disclose their age or because of an internet joke for the number of the year.

### Observation 4: Optimal riding times occurs during commute hours
- Citi Bike users ride mostly during the normal commute schedule from morning at 7 AM to 9 AM and evenings at 4 PM to 7 PM.
- The optimal time to check and maintain the bikes will be during the hours of midnight to 5 AM. 

### Observation 5: Shorter Trip lengths are better for customers
- Users get optimal benefit of using the Citi Bike service from trips between 5 to 20 minutes. This is true for both male and female riders proportionately.
- Placement of bike stations adjacent to bus stops or train stations will increase the value proposition of the service.
- Trip lengths less than 5 minutes can be discounted as trips that were 'canceled' prematurely.

### Observation 6: Peak hours for riding during the weekdays occurs during commute times
- Highest demand for bike sharing occurs Monday through Friday at 8 AM and 5 - 6 PM for the '9 to 5' working class population.
- Combining the observations from #2 and #4 we can begin to see a clear idea of our ideal target audience:
 - Urban living Working Millenials.
 - Active, cost conscious, tech savvy and prefer to use public transportation over driving.

### Final Observation: Ideal spots for Riding Stations near public trails and parks
- The map shows the hot spots for riding starting locations for Manhattan.
- The most popular areas for renting bikes are along popular trails and parks (by Hudson River and Central Park)
- These results suggest that the best areas to place Citi bike stations should be adjacent to less congested and protected natural areas.

## Summary

Although Manhattan is a more congested and populous city than Des Moine Iowa, they share similar characteristics that lend well to incorporating a bike sharing program:
